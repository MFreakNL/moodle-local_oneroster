# moodle-local_oneroster
An application specific implementation of One Roster for Moodle. Currently driven by a GUI at /local/oneroster/dashboard.php and designed for use with a specific Moodle site. To use this you will need to abstract it out to be generally useful, and probably automate some of what currently happens from events in the GUI. Get in touch if you need a hand or don't know what that means. 

Developed for Poodll by Michael Gardener.
